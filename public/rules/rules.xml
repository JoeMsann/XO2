      <title>Ultimate Rule: </title>
      <description> The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots.
        Next, the opponent plays, but they are forced to play in the small board corresponding to
        the location of the previous move, relative to the small board in which it was played. </description>

    <rule id="rule7">
      <title>What happens when a player wins a smaller board?</title>
      <description> The entire small board is marked as won by the player in the larger board. Once
        a small board is won or filled, no more moves may be played there. If sent to such a board,
        the player can choose to play on any other board. </description>

    <rule id="rule8">
      <title>Game End:</title>
      <description> Gameplay ends when either a player wins the larger board or there are no legal
        moves left, resulting in a draw. </description>

     <description>The player that plays the first move always has an advantage in this game 
     and is the favorite to win (assuming perfect play).</description>

    <rule id="rule10">
     <description>Game openings and strategies are much more complex in this variant of Tic-Tac-Toe,
      as each move is crucial to the outcome of the large board.</description>

     <description>There are no defined/clear strategies and openings, so the only way to master XO²
     is by practicing. Good luck! :)</description>
